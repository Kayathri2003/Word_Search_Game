# Motivation
To develop a word search puzzle that would be an interesting and entertaining way to improve their concentration, observation, logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
To explore more about the searching algorithms and implementing effectively.

# Problem Statement
To develop an online WORD-SEARCH game application with good visualization. 
Given a 2D grid of characters and a single word/an array of words, find all occurrences of the given word/words in the grid. 
Known that a word can be matched in all 8 directions at any point. 
To use appropriate algorithm and identify all characters of a word to match in this direction.
The 8 directions are, Horizontally Left, Horizontally Right, Vertically Up, Vertically Down and 4 Diagonal directions.

# Requirements
Using design languages like HTML,CSS and Javascript, for designing an interactive web page.
Implementation of a searching algorithm for solving the problem
Using MYSQL Database for storing the login credentials as well as maintaining a record of the players.
In order to drive the players and to provide them with new challenges, inclusion of three difficulty levels- easy, medium and hard.
Differentiation of the three difficulty levels through the numbers of words to find out, grid size and the orientations in which the words are placed.
For front-end, we require MySQL over web for which phpMyAdmin has to be used, so that the user information can be store in the database and updated or accessed.

# Dataset And Algorithm
Data structures:

     FRONT END: 2-D Array 
     This array contains a list of words from which the crossword puzzle is generated.

     BACK END: 2-D Array and Dictionary
     2-D Array contains a list of words and dictionary is used for storing the grid orientation.

Algorithm:
     Randomized Algorithm

# Tech Stack

Frontend tools: used to create a user friendly and interactive interface
HTML
CSS
JAVASCRIPT 

phpMyAdmin â€“ for an interface between MySQL database and HTML

Backend tools: working on server-side software
Python 

We have adopted scrum methodology wherein we have worked in different sprints and divided our work into timely requirement lists, revising the work plan when needed to satisfy the client requirements.
We have implemented this methodology using the JIRA Software.
